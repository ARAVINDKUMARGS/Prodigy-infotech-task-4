🔢 Prodigy Infotech Task 4 – Sudoku Puzzle Solver (Java)

📌 Description:

This project is part of the Prodigy Infotech Software Development Internship. The task was to develop a Sudoku Puzzle Solver using Java that automatically solves a 9x9 Sudoku grid using backtracking algorithm.


---

🧠 Key Features:

Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle

Uses Backtracking algorithm

Validates initial puzzle for correctness

CLI-based or GUI-based (depending on your implementation)

Fully coded in Java



---

💻 Technologies Used:

Language: Java

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code

Logic: Recursive backtracking



---

📸 Screenshots:

(Add your Sudoku grid screenshots here, e.g., before solving and after solving)


---

📂 Files:

Task4.java – Contains the main code for Sudoku Solver

README.md – This file

input.txt (Optional) – Example input for testing



---

▶️ How to Run:

1. Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/ARAVINDKUMARGS/Prodigy-infotech-task-4.git
